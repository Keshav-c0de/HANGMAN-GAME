# HANGMAN-GAME
This project is a basic, yet functional, text-based Hangman game. The program randomly selects a word, and the user attempts to guess the word one letter at a time. The game tracks which letters have been used and updates the display of the masked word with each correct guess.

The core of the game utilizes Python's built-in sets for efficient tracking of unique letters in the word and guessed letters.
